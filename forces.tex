Dont forget to introduce the density and hence a ruler for converting mass to size

\section{Gravity}

\section{Radiation pressure}

dont forget to introduce beta factor here and how it describes effective gravity

\section{Lorentz force}

Explain charging in plasma (super quickly) and give estimates of relevance of this force, include size (mass) and time in the estimates. Mention that if the grain has a lots and lots of time, then this could be relevant

\section{Poynting-Robertson drag}

timescale estimate 

\section{Erosion}

sublimation, sputtering

\section{Collisions}

crushing law
