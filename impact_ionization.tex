\section{Introduction}

start with energy density, mention shock wave (speed of sound) which concentrates the energy to 2D rather than 3D

\section{Laboratory simulation}

principle, capabilities, limitations (UV missing)

\section{History}

who found what and when. Mostly Friichtenicht, he is the Plato of impact ionization: all the later papers are footnotes to Friichtenicht.
