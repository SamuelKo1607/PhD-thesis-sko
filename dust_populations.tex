\section{The sources}

comets and else. Dont forget to introduce the density and hence a ruler for converting mass to size

\section{The forces}

gravity, radiation pressure, Lorentz, PR drag. First introduce and enumerate, then make a subsection for each

\subsection{Gravity}

\subsection{Radiation pressure}

dont forget to introduce beta factor here and how it describes effective gravity

\subsection{Lorentz force}

Explain charging in plasma (super quickly) and give estimates of relevance of this force, include size (mass) and time in the estimates. Mention that if the grain has a lots and lots of time, then this could be relevant

\subsection{Poynting-Robertson drag}

timescale estimate 


\section{Collisional balance in the zodiacal cloud}

Dohnanyi 1969 and a simple explanation that the power law slope doesn't depend on the crushing law
